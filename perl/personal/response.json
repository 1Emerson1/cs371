The new Associate Vice President will also ensure that the fundraising priorities of the Deans and their schools are vetted and ultimately met.\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>As a member of the senior leadership team within advancement, Parsons will report directly to Meer and work closely with University deans and department heads to coordinate funding priorities across academic units and centers of excellence.<\/p>\r\n<p>Parsons expressed that it is exciting to bridge communication between alumni and current students and extend to them new opportunities to help them succeed. \u201cWhether its funding scholarships for students or providing support for students to do research with faculty or supporting particular academic programs, it\u2019s very fulfilling to see dreams of making an impact on our campus come true,\u201d said Parsons, while explaining her excitement with working with professionals that aim to help the campus community succeed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>\u201cFor several years, Monmouth had an Assistant Vice President in this role. That person, Keith Richardson, left Monmouth early in 2018 to accept a Vice Presidency at another University. When I arrived in March, I wanted to ensure that we would attract a highly respected fundraising leader who would bring \u201cbest practices\u201d in the Development field to the University. So, we upgraded the position and folded several existing fundraising-related positions under the auspices of the new role,\u201d said Meer.<\/p>\r\n<p>\u201cThis hiring will bolster the University by increasing the funding for Monmouth\u2019s highest priorities. This year, as we conclude our Scholarship Campaign; \u2018Together We Can,\u2019 that means raising more scholarship dollars for our students and a larger endowment specifically restricted to student scholarships. In the future, that will mean funding for building needs, new and existing academic programs, faculty initiatives, athletics, and general operating support,\u201d said Meer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>\u201cAs Senior Class President and a member of the Scholarship Campaign, I see Wendy Parsons\u2019 addition to the team as a vital step in the creating of a culture focused on giving here at Monmouth,\u201d said Nicholas Verzicco, senior finance student, \u201cHer experience really adds value to the already strong leadership and I look forward to seeing her progress as she falls into her new role.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p>According to Meer, Parsons has proven herself to be a well-rounded fundraiser with experience ranging from St. Joseph\u2019s University, in a similar role as now, and Fox Chase Cancer Center. She received her undergraduate degree from Grinnell College and her master\u2019s degree from Stanford.<\/p>\r\n<p>During her tenure at Saint Joseph\u2019s, Parsons managed the public phase of its $150 million Faith to Dare Campaign and led the fundraising teams in major gifts, planned giving, parent giving, and corporate and foundation relations.<\/p>\r\n<p>Parsons said, \u201cI\u2019ve had the great pleasure of working with alumni to fund new scholarships for students and to provide millions of donors for financial aid which is vitally important for students today to achieve a high caliber, private higher education.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p>Her leadership was instrumental in the establishment of signature programs, growth in endowed and operating scholarship, and in the acquisition of the Maguire campus. Prior to Saint Joseph\u2019s, Parsons worked at Fox Chase Cancer Center for six years where she led their grateful patient fundraising program.<\/p>\r\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m an optimistic person. I have found that optimism will take you very far in life and in your career,\u201d said Parsons. \u201cI\u2019ve also admired Albert Einstein\u2019s view on life, and I have one of his quotations here in my office at Monmouth: \u2018There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p>\u201cThe biggest result I expect to come from hiring Wendy Parsons is a raising of the bar of our fundraising program. In the fiscal year that ended on June 30, we raised $9.2 million in gifts and pledges. That was more than 40 percent above what the University raised in the prior year,\u201d commented Meer.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;\u201cWith Wendy Parsons here, I hope and believe we will take our fundraising program to another level, perhaps $12-15 million this year. Our aspirations are to use that heightened level of performance as a springboard to even better results in the coming years,\u201d he continued.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Meer argues that the University is motivated to increase the academic and co-curricular experiences that our students have and to educate future alumni in our family.<\/p>\r\n<p>Parsons said, \u201cI\u2019d like to make a difference here at Monmouth by doing my best and helping others to do their best so that together we can achieve important new milestones for Monmouth going forward.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p>PHOTO COURTESY of Monmouth University<\/p>","catid":"146","images":{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""},"tags":[],"associations":[],"fields":[],"metakey":"","metadesc":"","metadata":{"robots":null,"author":null,"rights":null,"xreference":null},"language":"*","category_title":"Volume 91 (Fall 2018 - Spring 2019)","category_alias":"volume-90-fall-2018-spring-2019","author":"ANTHONY ROSSICS | STAFF WRITER","parent_id":"8","parent_title":"News","parent_alias":"news","parent_route":"news","created_date":"2018-10-31T15:38:51+00:00","modified_date":"2018-10-31T15:38:51+00:00","published_date":"2018-10-31T15:38:51+00:00","unpublished_date":"-0001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00","version":"1","hits":"182","rating":null,"rating_count":null,"state":"1"}
