  Monmouth Universityâs Computer Science and Software Engineering Department is encouraging everyone to join in on the largest learning event in history: The Hour of Code.
 </p>
 <p>
  Students and faculty from the department will be visiting several area schools to help kick-off their Hour of Code activities, and we have scheduled several Hour of Code sessions on our West Long Branch campus. One Hour of Code session on Wednesday Dec. 10 is for current University students, and sessions on Thursday and Friday are for the community where parents and children can complete an Hour of Code activity together. Monmouth University students and faculty will be available to answer questions as participants go through the self-guided coding experience.

 <p>
  Two CSSE Juniors, Justin Schlemm and Taylor Klodowski recently earned a second-place award at Marathon Data Systemsâ second annual âMarathon Hackathon,â which was held June 7 and 8 at Marathon Data Systemsâ office in Neptune.
 </p>
 <p>
  They also received a $400 prize for creating a mobile application to connect volunteers to relevant charity events. Their application, ChariTEA (technology, effort, action), allows charities to post times, dates and skill-set requirements when volunteers are needed. Volunteers can also post their skills, register for assignments and maintain a personal profile to keep a record of hours worked, which can be accessible to charity organizations as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Hackathon lasted over 26 hours and challenged teams of software developers from the tri-state area to create a fully functional application from scratch during the allotted time. The application was to focus on connecting volunteers, individuals or organizations to relevant local charity events.

  On March 29th, 2014, the IEEE/ACM student chapter of Monmouth University attended the IEEE Region 1 Student Conference at NJIT. At the conference Jake Vernon, President, had the opportunity to speak on behalf of the chapter during the Student Chapter Showcase. Following the showcase was the micro-mouse competition, where Sidhdhesh Patel, James Blessing, Justin Schlemm, Zixi Li, and Jake Vernon were able to display all their hard work that had been put into the device that they had been developing for months. Unfortunately the micro-mouse hardware did not function as intended, but the team was still asked to present their micro-mouse to all the other participants. Lead Developer, Sidhdhesh Patel, Vice President, lead the discussion and answered many software-related questions since the MU IEEE/ACM chapter was the only chapter present with a Software Engineering Background. During the awards dinner at the end of the conference, the chapter received an award for their participation in the Student Chapter Showcase.

   CSSE Department to Offer New Master of Science in Information Systems Degree
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Monmouth University Board of Trustees has approved the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering’s proposed Master of Science in Information Systems (MS-IS) degree program. The program is scheduled to be implemented starting in the Fall semester of 2014. The mission of the MS-IS program will be to integrate information technology and business management at the graduate level to provide well-trained students who would enter and be successful in local IT sectors. The goals of the program include the following:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   to prepare information system designers, developers, and/or administrators for successful employment;
  </li>
  <li>
   to produce scholarship in the area of information systems; and
  </li>
  <li>
   to provide the surrounding community with a viable opportunity to augment current information technology management skills with new and systematic knowledge.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  The Monmouth MS-IS program is designed to be interdisciplinary in that it brings together the fields of computer science, software engineering, and business management. The curriculum is designed to provide a sound basis for continued learning in the field beyond graduation. The degree program is designed to be either full time or part time and to prepare students for employment in the IT sector as information system developers or administrators. The program allows students to choose one of two tracks: the Technology Track or the Management Track. The Technology Track will emphasize the software life cycle, while the Management Track will emphasize information technology management and business strategic management.

   Gary Kagan, Software Engineering Major
  </p>
 </div>
 <p>
  On April 28-29, three of our Monmouth CSSE students participated in–and won–a 24-hour Hackathon called the Jersey Shore Comeback-A-Thon. Gary Kagan is currently an undergraduate Software Engineering major at Monmouth University, and Cory Cardio received his MS last year. Together with Margaret Kim, also a past CSSE student, they formed “Team Mango” and worked through the night on Saturday, developing a new and novel mobile app.
 </p>
 <p>
  The theme of the event was Jersey Shore Recovery from Super Storm Sandy and featured several talks by local businesspeople describing challenges that the Shore has faced in the past six months. The Hackathon challenge was to create a software application that could help businesses and local communities recover over the upcoming summer months. Team Mango created a “crowd-sourced application where members of the community could give and receive up-to-the-minute pertinent information in the event of a disaster like Hurricane Sandy, such as which businesses had electricity. Since connecting to the Internet was an issue for many during the storm, the application would include a texting component so users could update others as well as receive updates on their phone even if they did not have a Smartphone or could not get internet access.”
 </p>
 <p>
  When the dust cleared and the sun rose, the team of judges named Team Mango the winning team and awarded them the $1,000 first-prize. The event was sponsored by Marathon Data and was held at CoWerks in Asbury Park.

  <p>
   I joined MU in fall 2011 to study MS in software engineering. I am glad that I selected software engineering at MU.
  </p>
  <p>
   I am very much thankful to Dr. Daniela Rosca for providing me guidance on choosing the MS course. The faculty staff of Software Engineering offered me a wide range of support and advice about my academic career.
  </p>
  <p>
   I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely acknowledge and thank Dr. Jiacun Wang, my academic adviser and professor of some of my classes. Because of Dr. Wangâs continuous support and guidance I have successfully completed all my graduate courses.
  </p>
  <p>
   University environment and students across the Monmouth University are very friendly. I enjoyed being part of such a nice university. Course work that I completed during my time at Monmouth gave me strength in my technical skills. As a result of that I was able to successfully complete multiple internships during my graduate course. In addition, during my internship at Qualcomm Inc. my idea was selected in idea quest competition. Subsequently, my idea was selected for patent application.

   Professor Obaidat Featured In Asbury Park Press Article On Digital Reading Devices
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Computer Science and Software Engineering Professor Mohammad S. Obaidat was featured in the Asbury Park Press on 2/25/2012.
 </p>
 <p>
  (Excerpt:)
 </p>
 <p>
  Mohammad S. Obaidat, a professor of computer science and software engineering at Monmouth University and the editor-in-chief of several technical journals, said early predictions of a paperless culture were just premature, not wholly inaccurate. A Business Week article in June 1975 offered diverging views on the paperless office, an early mention of the concept.
 </p>
 <p>
  The tipping point of the decline of world paper use arrived as the Internet, e-business, e-government and social media made large strides, Obaidat said.
 </p>
 <p>
  Those developments rose along with the expansion of the economies of India and China, which allowed far more people to acquire information technology devices.
 </p>
 <p>
  Obaidat ticked off some of the benefits of a paperless world: fewer environmental issues like deforestation and greenhouse gas buildup, less space needed, greater searchability, reduced costs.
 </p>
 <p>
  “But are we ever going to be 100 percent paperless? I doubt it,” Obaidat said.
 </p>
 <p>
  Obaidat predicted that world paper consumption will decline by 75 percent by 2020.
 </p>
 <p>
  Steps like Google’s efforts to digitize existing books and the widespread acceptance of electronic signatures will speed the drop.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The world will be digital,” Obaidat said.

A press conference was arranged in the afternoon of Oct. 8 with the attendance of 10 local media agencies for this student recruitment activity. It was hosted by Mr. T.V. Reddy, the general secretary of St. Peters, who had visited Monmouth and signed an MOU with Dr. Bob McCaig in December, 2009.
 </p>
 <p>
  Besides St. Peters, Prof. Wang also visited the Vignan Institute of Technology and Science, and the Vardhaman College of Engineering on October 9. A potential MOU between Monmouth and Vignan is under discussion now.

 <p>
  For the sixth summer in a row, Monmouth University has offered a cutting-edge Computer Camp for students in middle school and high school. This camp, directed by Shauna Schubiger is taught by professors from the Software Engineering and Computer Science Departments. It is designed to provide advanced learning in computer skills, encourage teamwork, and promote creative thinking. Students have the opportunity to design their very own online portfolio to link all of the projects they create throughout the week. Sessions taught include Microsoft FrontPage and Dreamweaver for web design, Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator for graphic design, Windows Moviemaker for digital video, Alice and Flash for computer animation, Robotics, Flash for video game design, and Visual Basic for computer programming. Professors utilize a project-based learning approach to teach each different type of software to enable students to design based on their own particular interests. The culmination of this week-long camp ends with a parent showcase and the uploading of all projects to the Internet on individual student-designed websites. For more information on this camp, please contact Rebecca Hanly in the Computer Science Department at 732.571.7501.

 </div>
 <p>
  The book is a primer on managing software-based development projects and complex software/hardware systems. The book discusses the application of project management and general management techniques to large software development projects and complex software/hardware systems. This practical guide allows readers to reliably develop large software applications and systems that require the simultaneous development of electronic hardware and the software that controls the hardware. Each chapter is accompanied by a case study based on a case with which the author is familiar. This gives the reader experience in doing the management work. The author teaches readers how to use their own experience to improve the way they manage projects and provides a method for reviewing successes and failures to help increase their capabilities in the future. Managing the Development of Software-Intensive Systems serves as both an introduction to project management for software and hardware developers and as an advanced material resource for experienced managers. The contents will benefit managers of software-based development projects and organizations, as well as organizations that outsource development work. The book can also be used as a textbook in undergraduate or graduate courses in computer engineering, computer science, software engineering, information technology, commerce, and business administration with an information systems orientation.

Professor Kosaka showed the students how to analyze raw data, organize them, and create hypotheses so that appropriate data structures can be set up with a view towards data mining and machine learning. Such techniques are being developed to respond to the current demands (business intelligence, security and political intelligence, medical information) for sentiment and opinion analyses of unstructured data, especially on the internet. The students from the whole Academy attended, were very animated and asked many pertinent questions, particularly how Search Engines leverage such information.

   Graduate Program Changes Starting Academic Year 2009
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  We would like to detail changes to the Graduate CS Program starting in the Fall 2009 semester.
 </p>
 <p>
  The MS Degree will now require 30 credits (10 courses) for students with an adequate CS background (those who do not need to take any bridge courses). These students will be able to finish the degree in 1 calendar year (2 semesters and 1 summer).
 </p>
 <p>
  In the new graduate program, new students will choose between:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Track A (thesis)
  </li>
  <li>
   Track B (non-thesis)
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Additionally, students will have the option of choosing one of the following areas of specialization:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Databases and Intelligent Information Systems
  </li>
  <li>
   Security of Networks and Information Systems
  </li>
  <li>
   Computer Networks

  <strong>
   Significant CS Program Changes Starting Academic Year 2008
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  We would like to announce two recent program changes starting in the Fall 2008 semester.
 </p>
 <p>
  First, our initial instructional programming language has been changed to Java from C++ for both the B.S. and M.S. programs. With this change, the typical undergraduate student will begin their study of computer science by first taking CS 120 “Foundations of Computer Science” in the fall and then learning to program using the Java programming language in CS 175 “Introduction to Computer Science I” which is offered during the spring semester. Students who have an advanced placement score of 3 or better in CS can be given credit for CS 175 and can, therefore, continue their study of Java from high school by taking CS 176 during their first semester (fall) at Monmouth. Students will be introduced to C++ when they take CS 310 “Object Oriented Programming and Design” during their junior year. In the Graduate program, the bridge courses that involve programming â CS 501A, CS 501B, and CS 503 â will now use Java for instruction. Graduate students will now be exposed to programming in C++ in CS 509.
 </p>
 <p>
  Second, we now have two tracks in the BS program.
 </p>
 <p>
  Track A: Advanced Computing. This track is recommended for students who plan to go on to a graduate degree in computer science or who are interested in mathematical or scientific computing. Honors students must take this track. The track requires 26 credits of mathematics and science outside of the major.
 </p>
 <p>
  Track B: Applied Computing. The requirements within the major are identical to track A, but the only requirement outside of the major beyond the General Education requirements of Monmouth University is that the student take Math 109 “Pre-Calculus Mathematics” (or obtain an appropriate score in the mathematics placement test). This track is appropriate for students who plan to go directly to work in the software industry after graduation or to follow their undergraduate education with, for example, an MBA.
